# A-Tour-Around-US-National-Parks-A-Modified-TSP

This project focuses on a certain variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is known as the Prize Collecting Traveling Salesman Problem. For this project, we will be focusing on US National Parks instead of cities. First, we develop an algebraic model that generalizes the problem as a whole. Then we gather the data required to experiment with the model. From here we expect to get results, which will be then be analyzed. Finally, we determine if the model works and what changes can be made to improve the model.
